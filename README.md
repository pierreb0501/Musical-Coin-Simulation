Overview
This project integrates musical theory with a playful simulation of earning and spending coins through musical activities. It comprises three main components: a system for generating and playing musical notes, a module for creating melodies, and a simulation of earning coins through musical performances or tasks.

Modules
note.py: Defines the Note class to create musical notes with specific pitches, durations, and accidentals. This module is essential for generating the basic elements of music in the simulation.
melody.py: Builds on note.py to create sequences of notes, forming melodies. This module allows for the combination of notes into coherent musical phrases.
coins.py: Introduces a simulation aspect where users can earn coins based on musical tasks or performances. It could tie into the melodies generated, providing a gamified music theory learning experience.

Features
Music Generation: Generate and play back musical notes and melodies with varying pitches, durations, and dynamics.
Interactive Learning: Engage users in music theory through interactive tasks, improving their understanding and skills.
Coin Simulation: Introduce a fun, gamified element by rewarding users with virtual coins for completing musical challenges or tasks.
